# Data Science Task

## Setting up the environment
The data must be placed inside the \data folder. Otherwise, it is possible to adapt DATA_PATH variable from the notebook.
Additionally, all required packages are listed inside "requirementes.txt" for them to be installed by pip.

## Running the code
All the tests can be run from the notebook "challenge.ipynb", with a short explaination before each cell. The methods used in this notebook are implemented in the datatools folder. For a deeper insight, one should refer to the methods in "ECG_Manager.py". All algorithms are extensively commented in this class. In the case of utils.py, it contains the methods implemented as examples in the original physionet dataset.
