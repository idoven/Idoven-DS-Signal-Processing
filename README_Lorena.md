# Idoven- Data Scientist Task

## Lorena Romero

My proposal for the Idoven challenge is included in the notebook ECG_dataset_analysis.ipynb. 

I have mainly focused the work on the literature review of the problem, that I see as a necessary first step for any research project both for applied goals or for state-of-the-art modelling contirbutions. This allows to know both the benefits and limitations of existing methods, that I think is the basis to lay the foundations. 

The structure of the notebook is as follows:

- Literature review: some relevant papers are commented and referenced.
- Working with PTB-XL data set: although the proposal is mainly focused on modelling review, I have also searched existing packages for ECG analysis. In this section, I have explored the PTB-XL data set using wfdb, ecg_plot and neurokit2 packages (plus the usual ones). 
- Some conclusions and personal comments have been added at the end of the section.

I have found the challenge super interesting because I have learnt about existing tools of segmentation, analysis and visualization that look super useful also for general time series application. I was super surprised about the bunch of papers about specific ECG modelling (classification, segmentation, anomaly detection...) and python examples for ECG analysis. It was my first time working with this data set (and ECG signals) and I think that many general time series techniques for change-point detection can be useful for heart disease prevention. I really enjoyed learning more about this field. 

This is a super early stage of the research but there seems to be a lot to do!

Thanks for the opportunity.
