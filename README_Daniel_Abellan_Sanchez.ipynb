    "In order to solve them, I have used several specific signal processing libraries such as [wfdb](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [HeartPy](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [ecg_plot](https://github.com/dy1901/ecg_plot). There is a short explanation in each notebook, as well as descriptions of the functions and comments on each required instruction.\n",
